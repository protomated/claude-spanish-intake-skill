# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

**Spanish Intake Skill** — a Claude Desktop plugin for solo and small-firm attorneys. One skill (`/spanish-intake`): Conducts bilingual (English/Spanish) client intake and communication: turns Spanish-language intake notes or a voicemail transcript into a structured English intake summary for the file, and turns an English draft communication into a natural Spanish version — flagging any ambiguous translation for the attorney's confirmation rather than guessing. There is no runtime code, no MCP server beyond declared connector requirements, and no backend. The product is entirely content: a markdown skill file and JSON manifests.

This repo is the source of truth for this skill's content. It also ships via the [Protomated plugin marketplace](https://github.com/protomated/protomated-plugins-official) — re-sync that repo's copy manually when this one changes.

## Repo layout

```
plugin/           The installable plugin (packaged into .zip)
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json   Manifest validated by scripts/validate-plugin.mjs
  .mcp.json                    Empty — connector-free, attach-only workspace access
  skills/spanish-intake/SKILL.md  The single skill; YAML frontmatter + markdown body
scripts/
  validate-plugin.mjs          Validates plugin/ structure before packing
```

## Commands

```bash
npm run validate   # validate plugin/ structure
npm run build       # validate → pack → checksum
npm run release      # build + gh release create
```

## Compliance constraints — non-negotiable

1. **Confirmation gating**: Claude must show the attorney exactly what it will do and get explicit in-conversation confirmation before sending email, creating calendar events, or writing any file.
2. **Required output wrapper**: every skill output must begin with `AI-ASSISTED DRAFT — ATTORNEY REVIEW REQUIRED` and end with the `Not legal advice` footer.
3. **Plan-tier warning**: consumer-tier Claude (claude.ai Personal / Pro) must not be used with client-privileged content.

Do not weaken these constraints.
